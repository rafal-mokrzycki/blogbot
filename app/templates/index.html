<p>Welcome to the home page.</p>
<p>This is a demo of BlogBot that enables you to post on LinkedIn automatically.
    Our app retrieves data (headlines and articles) from the biggest news
    providers and posts short summaries of them on your LinkedIn wall. You
    choose the schedule and leave the rest to us!</p>

    Comment:
        Your bucket names must meet the following requirements:

        Bucket names can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Spaces are not allowed. Names containing dots require verification.
        Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
        Bucket names must contain 3-63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
        Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
        Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
        Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings, such as "g00gle"."""

    MAX_LENGTH = 63
    MIN_LENGTH = 3
    forbidden_pattern = r"^g[oO0]{2}g(le)?[a-z0-9_\-]*[a-z0-9]?$"
    if len(bucket_name) > MAX_LENGTH or len(bucket_name) < MIN_LENGTH:
        return False
    if re.fullmatch(forbidden_pattern, bucket_name):
        return
    valid_pattern = r"^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_\-]*[a-z0-9]$"
    return bool(re.fullmatch(valid_pattern, bucket_name))
